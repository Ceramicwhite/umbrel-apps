description: >-
  A Matrix client focusing primarily on simple, elegant and secure interface. 
  The main goal is to have an instant messaging application that is easy on 
  people and has a modern touch.

  - Organized

    Navigation is easy now because we organized DMs separate from channels.

  - No more clutter

    You will see what's necessary to give you a better visual feedback.

  - Input that matters

    An interface which adapts to your actions without making you feel uncomfortable.

  - Calm visual

    Everything is properly aligned and formatted to give you a calm feeling.

  You can connect it to the Synapse installation running on your Umbrel. 
  An easy way to get started is to install the "Synapse" Matrix homserver on 
  your Umbrel and change Cinny's Homserver URL from matrix.org to your Synapse's 
  homeserver URL (http://umbrel.local:8008 or http://<synapse-tor-hidden-service-url).
